# Why This Is Different

Most AI systems today rely on trust.

This one does not.

---

## Common Approaches

### Prompt Engineering
Relies on persuasion.
No guarantees.

### Fine-Tuning / RLHF
Bakes behavior into weights.
Opaque and irreversible.

### Agent Frameworks
Give models tools and hope for alignment.

## This System

- No training
- No fine-tuning
- No hidden logic
- No trust

All decisions pass through:
- explicit states
- formal transitions
- auditable rules

---

## Key Difference

**Control is external, symbolic, and inspectable.**

This mirrors how safety is handled in:
- avionics
- nuclear systems
- operating system kernels

But applied to cognition.

## Summary

This system does not make models smarter.

It makes systems safer.
